#####Body#####

1. A Phyſicall obſervation of the Pruſian Swallow-knife.

    _ Of the ſwallowing of the Knife. The firſt Section.

      * The firſt Poſition. The diſcent of the Knife, of the length of tenne thumbes breadth, by the mouth and mouth of the ſtomack to the Ventricle indeed wants not admiration, but includes no impoſſibility.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition the 2. As Knives and other abhorrent things by a certaine kind of Sorcery may bee throwne downe, or inſinua•ed into the Ventricle: ſo uſually mans Mclancholicke Genius conceites it ſo to bee.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition the 3. The Knife that was ſwallowed by the benefit of Naturall heat, might be ſomewhat altered in the Ventricle, but not digeſted or conſumed: therefore was it well concluded by the Colledge of Phyſitians, that by Section the ſame was to bee extracted.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition 4. As the knife which was ſwallowed downe could not have bin conſumed by nature, ſo by her neither could it any way have bin evacuated: And ſince its longer ſtay in the Ventricle might have inferred no little moleſtation and dammage; it was by Section to be pulled out.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition the 5. The members of our body doe uſually ſo imbibe the Balſamicke vertue of internall Remedies, that they are very ſtrong againſt growing diſeaſes.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition 6. As the Attractive quality of the Herculean ſtone is ſcarce perſcrutable whereby even through a hinderance lying in the way, it is able to exerciſe its faculty: So whether
the ſame, being pulverized and mixed with other Medicaments, it retaine the ſame power of attracting Iron, is a thing that very worthily deſerves iudgement and enquiry.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition the 6. That the worth of the Ventricle it is great, the benefit greater, the neceſſity greateſt, yet the wounds thereof not to be reckoned of (if they touch not the upper part of the Orifice) as neither becauſe of the membranous ſubſtance to bee thought mortall in themſelves, yet not voyd of danger.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition 8. As the ſuddaine cloſing of the wound of the Ventricle, ſo too the excretion of clotted bloud by Vrine is to bee reckoned for a benefit of a provident nature.

Poſition 4.

Poſition 5:

Poſition 7.

Poſition 8.

Poſition 10.

      * Poſition 9. As the great wounds of the parts are not to bee left to a Prognoſticke onely: So neither are ſmall wounds to be diſ-regarded, for of every kind of wounds men may dye, as Hippocrates teacheth, and experience confirmes.
