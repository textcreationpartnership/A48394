            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſame almoſt happened to a certaine friend who at a marriage dinner too greedily ſwallowing a piece of roſted Kid, preſently incurred the danger of ſuffocation, ſo as hee could neither ſpeake, nor breath untill having beene vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently beaten upon the backe, and put his finger into his throate, the morſell was thruſt downe to the ventricle, whereby hee himſelfe was freed from totall ſuffocation, and we the ſitters by from feare.</p>

                  <p>That death it ſelfe too often followes the ſubſequents doe declare. One that would ſwallow a Hen-egge whole,

               <p>Theſe Phyſitians after they had conſidered what was to be conſidered, and examined the things that were to be examined, concluded that there was not here any hurt of the phantaſie or imagination, but that a knife indeed was ſwallowed and lurked within the body. The twenty fifth day of <hi>Iune</hi> therefore was indicted for a meeting of the Phyſitians, which was celebrated in the Garden of Maſter Doctor <hi>Lothus,</hi> the prime and ſenior Profeſſour, and chiefe Electurall Phyſitian at that time ſicke, in the place of the Deane and others the maſter Phyſitians.

There hee theſe that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce here the Identity of ſubſtance, and ſo indeed Iron ſhould attract Iron: but there is in Iron, and there is in the Load-ſtone a peculiar Spirit, both of them friendly uſing a familiarity betwixt themſelves and conſpiring.

                  <p>This excellent vertue of Attraction as, it is by all almoſt granted to bee in the Load-ſtone when 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, ſo whether alſo being pulverized it can doe the ſame, is a thing queſtioned. <hi>Libavius Lib. 1.

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That in the pulverized Load-ſtone there can bee no Ordination of the <hi>Poles</hi> to draw Iron to Iron, for it may bee ſo done that even the <hi>Poles</hi> driving Iron to Iron may be directed, and ſo not traction, but a further promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather of the Iron would ariſe.</p>

To the Second, It is held untrue that there cannot bee even in the leaſt portion of the Load-ſtone, the <hi>Pole</hi> and the <hi>Aequator,</hi> for otherwiſe it would follow that there is not in any Load-ſtone either the <hi>Pole,</hi> or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62419:25"/>the <hi>Aequator,</hi> except that pure earth ſhould the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite; or that ſo onely there were in every Minerall one onely <hi>Aequator,</hi> whereof yet the contrary experience ſhewes, ſince but from one greater Load-ſtone Artificers can turne many leſſer Globes, of which every one hath his <hi>Pole</hi> and his <hi>Aequator;</hi> to ſay nothing that the Load-ſtone is a kind of ſimilar body whereof anon. To the third <hi>Cabeus</hi> ſhall ſupply his Anſwer, who in the quoted place affirmes, that there is nothing in nature can deprive the Load-ſtone of its faculty but fire and old age: for the Load-ſtone being exagitated by the fire doth looſe his flagrant ſulphureous Spirit, which being loſt there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, with all that tractive quality reſiding in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous or ſulphureous ſpirit as was ſaid before. But by old age the radicall moyſture, as in all other mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, doth not ſo totally periſh as 'tis ſoporated, becauſe as the ſame <hi>Cabeus</hi> teſtifieth, the Load-ſtone revives if put againe to another perfect Load-ſtone,<note place="margin">P. 131.</note> and by the ſame impregnated. To the fourth which concernes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the body <hi>Trahent</hi> ano <hi>Trahend,</hi> I ſay, we muſt not reſpect ſo much to the corporeall quantity, but the active quality rather: for if we ſhall ſubiect other notable medicinall compoſitions, to an Examen, even a ſmall portion of an ingredient will promiſe a great effect. And indeed let us looke upon the very Simples. How great vertue ingredes the body of the <hi>Hart,</hi> with the Dietany hee expells the Arrowes that are inflicted on him? What proportion is there betwixt a violent <hi>Catharticke</hi> and the humours to be drawne and evacuated, where but one onely pill very often ſufficeth, and which uſually can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an <hi>Hyper catharſis?</hi> Is there not, by the benefit of a medicament aſſumed, and from a far off, either from the head or from any part of the body, the peccant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſantly drawne forth, whether yet not the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall maſſe but the vertue onely of the Medicine arriveth: why therefore ſhould not the Magneticall quality communicated with an unguent ſuffice? To the fifth it may bee alleaged, that the choyceſt Load-ſtone is to bee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62419:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>elected that is to bee permixed with an Emplaſter, if chiefly that effect ought to be hoped for: But that which hath its Minerall ſpirit exhaled by fire or old age is inſtly to be refuſed, ſince it can retaine no longer the vertue of Attraction.</p>
                  <p>For the contrary opinion, other ſequent Reaſons there are more weighty that may be produced undertaking the Patronage of a tractive vertue in the pulverized Load-ſtone. <hi>1.</hi> The vertue or that Magnetticall tractive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in all, and all in every part, as affirmes <hi>Cabeus</hi> and <hi>Gilbertus</hi> diſſents not from him.<note place="margin">L. 2. p. 105.</note> The ſmalleſt pieces therefore of the Load-ſtone endowed with this ſpirit have beene able alſo to draw Iron: for neither is the Load-ſtone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Let the ſame Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bee of the Load-ſtone. Secondly the ſpirit of the Load-ſtone is of a Minerall quality, and hath a ſteady nature, ſo as that it can not eaſily be parted from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or the parts thereof, yea the ſmaller parts, which evsn the examples of other Saline and ſulphureous Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls doe atteſt; the Load-ſtone therefore ſhall looſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its vertue by, trituration or being pulverized.

Fourthly, if a

Secondly, that the Magneticall needle too being onely toucht hath the leaſt parcell of the Load-ſtone, Howbeit affect each other, and deſire to unite through Boardes or a ſtone Table, more therefore the greater part. Fiftly Nature, who is a Conſerver of her Domicill, endeavoureth ſomething ſtill to defend and repaire the ſame: and therefore ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours much and intentively in the faculties of the very Load-ſtone, and as it were recollects and unites them diſperſed through the Emplaſter, that it may bee able to performe the more ſuccesfull effect.

               <p>The ſeventh day of the Diſeaſe, and the fifteenth of the moneth he had a quiet night of it, his Pulſe ſtrong enough and now ſeemed to bee ſafe, the wound after the uſuall manner was bound up, and the ſame done againe in the after-noone.</p>

                  <p>IT is a golden Rule of our Divine <hi>Hippocrates</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>A veterum doctrinâ reſidere, &amp; nova praeter rationem comminiſci, cum per ſe temeratium eſt, tum in faciendo periculoſum.</hi> To recede from the Doctrine of the Ancients, and to invent new wayes againſt reaſon is in it ſelfe as temerarious as in doing it is dangerous. For albeit there are many things left for this latter age to find out and amplifie, yet if the ancient things be altered and new induced againſt reaſon not ſo much for verities ſake and utility, as for novelty and poore ſelfe glory, it will ſcarce be able to deſerve excuſe. The old Phyſitians who chiefly placed their endeavours upon Chirurgery, did furniſh the ſame with exceeding great ſtudy, and intermitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might make for the perfection thereof, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to goe backe from their Decrees is an offence that many neoterickes can not ſatisfie. All other waſes being left. our Patients caſe propounds two at leaſt; one concernes the uſe of Tenis, the other Deligation inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twice a day; both they iudge unneceſſary, yea ſuperva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneous and to bee ſuperſeded for an unprofitable labour. For <hi>Caſar Magatus</hi> and with him <hi>Septalius,</hi> whom too doe follow many Chirurgions with very ill ſucceſſe, ſuppoſe, that there is no need of Tents in wounds, nor of deligation to be uſed twice a day, for thinke they Tents moleſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by diſtention, compresſion of the part affected, and excitation of dolors. Secondly that they availe nothing, ſince the vertue of the Medicaments without Tents can duely bee carried downe to the part offended. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

But on the contrary if deligation bee more ſeldome and ſlowly uſed, that the Temperament of the part offended remaineth in its due ſtate, that but little matter of excrements is begotten, that the naturall heate is conſerved in its owne vigor, that all ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are precautioned, and that the cure of the wound may ſooner and more ſucceſfully bee finiſhed, for the nature of the part helped with externall Balſame of its very owne accord haſteth unto conſolidation and averts the ſymptomes to bee ſeared. Notwithſtanding as theſe may take place in wounds ſuperficiall and but ſhallow <hi>Tagaultius</hi> ſo adviſing,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.

For there's no reaſon that wes ſhould feare an intemperate aire, but eſpecially the cold and moiſt, an enemy to wounds, ſince that may either bee avoyded or even with Art ſo corrected, that no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage can bee thence expected, if by the helpe either of fire or ſome thing elſe the aire bee diſpoſed unto a fit temperateneſſe, which being done, the naturall beat
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62419:41"/>of the parts affected, whereon I willingly confeſſe turnes the hinge of all the Cure, is conſerved in its due ſtate, no alteration of the Temperament of the part followes after, nor will there bee a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull heaping of excrements, then according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wound.

                        <item>Secondly alſo, that hee fit the Remedies to the ſtate and condition of the part and wound, for their conſtitution greatly requires that ſome Medicaments be dry, ſome moiſt, for neither during the whole time of the Curation will one Remedy be able to ſuffice.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, that by daily deligation cleannes alſo may bee procured, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> advertiſeth to bee heeded, that the fouleneſſe of the bandages and clouts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt not the Patient.</item>
                        <item>Fourthly, becauſe <hi>Pus</hi> beeing daily ſo evacuated, even nature alone haſteth to its Conſolidation: for as ſometimes ſhee alone doth accompliſh this, ſo is ſhe not able likewiſe to evacuate that.</item>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62419:60"/>being the ſpring and firſt buddings of nature may carry with it ſome ſucceſſe in naturalizing contraries with our bodies; ſince in the growth of things ſuch endeavours may be made moſt effectuall by the necesſity of increaſe, through which the body accepts ſuch intentions (in the receipt) as aliment, and therefore is converted: as wee may perceive in Plants whoſe colour and taſt may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the likeneſſe of others, if as ſoone as the ſeed is ſowne, and that the earth hath ſwolne it with its moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, we obſerve convenient waterings, with ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures needfull (well knowne to the skilfull Gardiner) which in the maturity of them cannot bee: ſo in our full yeares, when we are confirmed, or neare confirmation, when grouth of ſpermatick parts ceaſe, and the Collumes of the body (the bones) have arrived unto their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuch concluſions muſt have a more able reſiſting, even to denyall, beſides our reaſon and imagination which in ſuch Caſes pleades with our pallats.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this ſearch I will not buſie my ſelfe with the varieties of Authors that write on this ſubject, which being collected and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether appeare a very confuſion. I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine ſo far as my owne Genius ſhall direct me; Firſt, the nature of the faculties of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netes, briefly. Secondly its ſubſtance. Thirdly, the working and congruity of its vertues in that ſubſtance. Fourthly and laſtly, I will ſurvay our Authors reaſons from other ſimples grounded, to confirme the power of attraction to be retayned in the loadeſtone being pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized: and of theſe in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore concerning the faculties, it is to bee queſtion'd whether the power attractive and reſpective are wrought in the Stone by one ſpirit or no? ſince as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Poles, it hath a will to paſſe unto them, but in the vigour of attraction to pull unto it ſelfe what it delights in: which are diſtinct vertues, and may argue a double ſpirit; but if we regard how inſeparably theſe are united together, it is to be imagined (with ſome boldneſſe) that theſe two functions are done by one onely ſpirit: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if wee conſider how exact it is in all its affections, without change or contradiction; in both whoſe efficient powers, there is but one onely order of diſpoſing, and that immutable, yet each vertue with a certaine dependancy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62419:62"/>upon each other, and thereby mutually asſiſting, for ii they were acted by a double ſpirit, proper to either vertue, this could not be without change, as thoſe ſpirits ſhall bee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingly exaſperated, or leſſened, which in one ſpirit cannot yet alter order; which is unchangeable in its work either quickned, or dulled.</p>
                  <p>Secondly concerning its ſubſtance, we may thinke if we will not admit a confuſion, theſe to be brought to paſſe by one onely vigour in it ſelfe, and yet asſiſted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Poles, endewing the ſtone with a Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force to reſiſt time, or age: firſt in it ſelfe properly living, which may well be ſaid; for as the breath is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t into our bodies by the Divine Creator, yet (by divine inſtitution) it is maintayn'd in our bodies, by their owne effectuall working with ſpirits, which ſubſiſt in nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So, although the vertues may be Planetary, and brought into the ſtone by Influence, yet by a ſubtill elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the ſtone they are ſuſtayn'd, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly living in it ſelfe, as alſo becauſe if it be divided into many portions, yet every lumpe will have its <hi>Aequator,</hi> from which it equally divides and diſpoſes its vertues, to either Pole reſpectively.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diviſions wrought and alter'd by the vigour of reſpects, which although it bee not done, by the ſubſtance of the ſtone altogether, yet it is by the ſpirit reſpecting, ſuſtained in it, and may challenge ſome ſhare in that worke; next, being ſo endew'd, many handred yeares cannot viſibly abate the qualities of the ſmalleſt ſtone, or deliver it periſhable in the leaſt: being alſo manifeſted, by ſuch equall alterations in the ſtone, which ſhewes its influence and Planetary immutability, which a though it be not ſo ſtrictly knit to the ſubſtance of the ſtone, yet it is made a part of it by it; habitation.</p>
                  <p>Further it muſt neceſſarily be poſſeſt of a power in it ſelfe, becauſe all bodies enricht with the influence of any conſtellation muſt have a fit and congruable ſubſtance, to entertaine, nouriſh, and hold ſuch qualities: alſo the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall effects of ſome ſtones, more then other, approve
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62419:63"/>it, as they ſhall bee of ſubſtance, able to enterfaine ſuch a quantity of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Next it is of a ſimilar growth, by its ſingularity of Sympathy onely with Iron, not having affinit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with any other Minerall, nor mixt with any other affection, which witneſſeth a power in it ſelfe able to give unto it, and this not done by an abſolute necesſity, as compell'd by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination, but voluntary as it giveth or requiteth, although there may be ſome ſuch necesſity ſuſpected in its attraction for nutritions ſake.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly concerning its agreement of the vertues in its ſubſtance, if we examine what hath bin diſputed in the two former parts, we may well conclude that the foirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is chiefly derived from the influence of the Poles, yet inhabiting the ſubſtance of the ſtone, though not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and miraculouſly mixt with the power attractive in the ſame body, with which it paſſeth into the Iron; the ſpirit reſpective quickning the vertue attractive, and the vertue attractive fed and nouriſht by an admirable vertue in the Iron, which is made evident in the delight it enjoyeth in its proximity: the power of the Magnetes, in both quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vivified and made more active, eſpecially the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, by the Iron as it is foode, out of which as the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netes extracteth nutriment, ſo it infuſeth its proper excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and by which it beſtowes both the actuall and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall efficacy of it ſelfe, more powerfully to other portions of the Irons nature, which is made plaine in touching the Mariners Compaſſe Needle, for the Poles of the ſtone muſt be engirt with Iron, which Iron giveth the vertues, for as the ſtone exacts a tribute of food, by inviſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; ſo doth it inviſibly infuſe the ſame meaſure of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the Iron it extracteth, to ſhun vacuity: the ſpirits of the Iron being this food, by a naturall propinquity and the ſubſtance; the ready and ſubtill diſtributer of its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with a wonderfull equality and pureneſſe: as if in it of thoſe ſpirits, there were a ſecond and neceſſary change for ſuch uſes.</p>
                  <p>Now if what hath beene ſaid holdeth any ſcope worthy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62419:63"/>beleefe, then wee muſt conclude the ſpirit attractive is wrought by necesſity, requiring nutriment, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſpirit reſpective in the attraction; and ſince theſe qualifies are infuſed by our onely ſpirit, dwelling in the ſtone, and done by Will, not compulſion (although the reſpective ſpirit is principally derived from the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Poles, yet pleaſed to inhabite the bowells of the ſtone, and there maintayned in its fulneſſe and vigour. It muſt neceſſarily follow, that if the reſpective ſpirit bee loſt in tituration, as it muſt needs bee; the vertue attractive muſt conſequently periſh, ſince the reſpective power is the life of it, quickning, and making it active in all its duties.</p>

                  <p>Firſt if the Magnetes bee generally, the Pallace of theſe Vertues as the body is to the ſpirit, yet ſince the power attractive is particularly fixed, and chiefly and moſt powerfully plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there where the reſpective flame delighteth to dwell, we muſt agree that theſe vertues are not ſo eſſentially in the ſubſtance of the ſtone, ſince in two peculiar poynts of it, the ſpirits of reſpect pleaſe to appeare (diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing either pole) which pull unto them the vigour of attraction, being the duller power, to bee convay'd with the nimbler ſpirits of reſpect into the nature of the Iron, by which that wonderfull infuſion of qualities is effected: then if theſe powers are not every where equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, but unſteady and flying (although our Authour
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62419:64"/>concludes them to be moſt firme and ſtable which this laſt aſſertion refutes) how can we hope, or by what reaſon ſhall we expect theſe powers to be detayned in the ſtone ſo exquiſitely reduced into powder, as the compoſition of an emplaſter requireth.</p>
                  <p>Further if we conſent that theſe ſpirits are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayed, and ſo remaine in every parcell of the Magnetes, and flying out where the moſt ſubtill part of the ſtone is, yet I would know by what power the vertues are ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, by diviſion; as if you ſeparate by the <hi>Aequator</hi> (as neare as posſible may be attempted) the Articke from the articke, yet either part will aſſume unto it ſelfe an <hi>Aequat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Is not this wrought by a Planetary Influence in the reſpective vertue, able to alter its owne property and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the attractive power when ſo divided, and to quicken it to its proper effect by a necesſity in either Pole to exact its tribute: and doth not the Pole raiſed partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the greateſt portion of the ſtone by reaſon the earths condenſe body interpoſing the one, and the other by its proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and being without any ſuch interpoſition, made more lively, and doth not the attractive power alſo where the reſpective is weakened, faile in equall proportion with the reſpective? Aſſuredly yes; now can theſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſteady, or are they not by influence there planted, Theſe by experience made manifeſt: worthily approveth the concluſion of the third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Moreover to adde the Sinewes of another reaſon to the former, ſince the attractiue ſo abſolutely (as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to me depends upon the ſpirit of reſpect, and that alſo the <hi>Aequator</hi> neceſſarily is from the diviſion, certainely wee will conſent, there muſt be a body left to entertaine theſe diſtinct vertues, viz. The vertues attractive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of either Pole, with the <hi>Aequator,</hi> becauſe they worke in and by that body, or elſe if any vertue bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or the body (being not of capacity to receive them)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62419:64"/>deny their ſociety, ſince their number, and unity is ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, we cannot but allow a notable deprivation of their vertues, if not an utter ruine, and what ſubſtance can there be in the Magnetes, for ſuch receivings of qualities ſo titurated? even as the fineſt Flower if we will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art confect an Emplaſter. Moreover in union things beſt maintaine their vigour.</p>

                  <p>Some are of opinion that the fountaine of this reſpective ſpirit, is about or neare the center of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Their reaſons are drawne from certaine experiments from the Mariners Compaſſe, for the point of the Needle being toucht hath a kind of inclination downewards, which they terme dipping: alſo if the Needle by the South end of the ſtone be endew'd, yet on this ſide the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall it will have a northern reſpect, though not ſo nimbly in its quality appearing if toucht by the Articke ſeate of that vertue, in which ſudden change and ſubtill paſſage, there muſt be an excellent ſpirit allow'd, agreeable in all points to what hath bin <hi>prae</hi>-written but the verity of this aſſertion I leave to be made knowne by time and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for ſince in no manner it weakneth the argument in mention, but if well and truely conſider'd ſtrengthens it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe it appeareth ſtrange unto me, that ſince it is generally knowne that the Magnetes (poſſeſſeth two Poles) and yet ſhould not infuſe the like diſtinct vertues by touch, into the points of the Needle, but with ſo ſwift a mutation of the vertues of the one into the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the other, which rather ſeemeth to bee a defect then a power.</p>

Indeed the Diſeaſe, the Cauſe, and ſtrength of the Patient, are thoſe three principles, which we ſhould alwaies reſpect, and labour to be well inſtructed in. Firſt, the Diſeaſe muſt employ our underſtanding to know, if it either in quantitie quality, or both offend, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, abounding, or together. Next if one humour, more or all it hath infected, to which may bee added, where the ſeate of the evill is, if in the noble parts, or parts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet equally dangerous, or other waies, or whether the griefe hath implanted it ſelfe in one, more, or in all parts ſerving, by its owne proper quality and venime, as in peſtilent Fevers, &amp;c. or accidentally.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond needfull enquiry is, of the Cauſe, whether that hath power, from the defects and want of nature in it ſelfe, or by accident and diſorder.

The accidentall are innumerable, and from different meanes, the diſquiets by diſorder are likewiſe many, but commonly our owne.</p>
                     <p>The third <hi>quaere</hi> is the ſtrength and eſtate of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted body, totally, as in Fever, &amp;c. from one Cauſe, or

                     <p>Theſe circumſtances are ſo needfull, that without their knowledge we cannot promiſe to the ſicke any hope of their recovery being never ſo apparent, but the Phyſitian ſhall be puzled with many varieties, which will ſhift his reaſon into a labyrinth of idle doubts, neither can he (if hee bee ignorant of theſe) adviſe himſelfe by the Index of nature whether it be ſafe to attempt, <hi>Ex irpare, aut morbum pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liare, haec enim opera in verâ cauſae et virum conſideratione conſtant et indicata ſunt.</hi> The Hiſtories he hath numbred &amp; related, of many that have lived without ſome principall part, in ſome meaſure ſupporting the throne of life, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altogether ſo fit to my beleefe as to conclude them worth repetition, yet of this anon.

I returned (upon this conſultation with my ſelfe) to them, their liberty of feeding both in quantity and quality: whereby their ſtrength was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored, and their wounds recover'd, the diſgeſtive power more commendably, even to conſolidation and ſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice

                  <p>Thirdly Congruity, both of medicine and part muſt be enquired after: in the defect of either there may follow, inflamation, or ſtupefaction, and from both, different and fatall endings, or extenuation, or ſome Hydropick diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions either in body or limbe, or from both, to both a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ruine.</p>

                  <p>Of this ranke of Practitioners, are Tooth-drawers, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62419:72"/>Fortune-tellers, and that rabble of women, which ſtrut up and down with their skill in their pockets, which they purchaſed from the Chyrurgions boy for ſome Garment trifle, when the events of their luſts, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes and poverty thruſt them into the <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> to bee patcht up (for this employment) by thoſe worthy houſes of charity: neither will they omit, to boulſter out their wickedneſſe, with ſome ſhew of ability, to thoſe whoſe miſfortunes, and ſottiſh ignorance hath throwne them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, and their owne beds, in depraving the worth of ſo many worthy gentlemen, the Phyſitians and Chirurgions of thoſe two free Manſion-places for the poore and maimed; whoſe knowlenge and care meete in one Center, and are equall, both great, and each one the cauſe of the other, and inſeparably united.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, whereas he ſaith the pasſions of this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Anger, or Feare in ſuperficiall wounds ſhould alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether be the cauſe of ſuch deplorable concluſions, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve his teſtimony; certainely the vitiouſneſſe of humours flowing to wounded members (often times the abundance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62419:73"/>properly be call'd a pasſion) but as the ſuddaine ebullition of the ſpirits, cauſeth a drawing unto the heart by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant heate which naturally attracts the ſpirits diſperſt into the Arteries and Veines, in the ſervice of the body; ſo doth it as readily drive them out againe, to execute what the mind in ſuch rage ſhall either conceive to be a revenge, a ſatistaction, or remedy, inſomuch that the parts of the body not left deſtitute of heate for many minutes, cannot periſh by an Apopler, unleſſe the matter was prepar'd, and lurking in the braine, that labour'd under ſuch a griefs, which this ſhort deprivation of heate may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as our Author affirmes.</p>
                  <p>Next feare is of a more killing nature, ſince it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe that liveth in the body for much time, as the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall enforce: beſides, as it is properly ſeated in the heart, which man ſenſibly ſeeleth (although the animall ſpirits in the braine by their faculty, through knowledge of the cauſe and event, preſents it and makes it available) ſo it defuſeth an evill ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Further ſudden terrour, of al the reſt is moſt apt to bring forth ſuch lamentable events; for this pasſion not onely ſeiſeth on the heart, with a ſtrong power of feare, whereby as it were cruſhath it to pieces, but by a neceſſary and furious calling backe the vitall ſpirits (ſent abroad into the channells of nature) to its aide; it threatneth a ſtifling in the proper Veſſells of the heart. Beſides, in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there is a boyling of the arteriall bloud, by which their quality of heate is maintayn'd, which burſting forth meets the flowing of the ſpirits, and thruſteth them backe, to their ſeate &amp; duties, and reviveth them by piercing through them; but in this aſſaulf there is no ſuch elaboration, but a dulling even to inſenſibility, without any quickning,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62419:73"/>whereby followes a greater freezing of them in their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and place of arrivall, ſo that they returne not, if in part they doe, yet it is with an irrecoverable feeblenes: Further, ſcare hath its expectation, and can Iudge of the concluſion, which may a little refreſh, but in this there is neither; not through reaſon, but the pasſion afflicted and ruling in its extremity: the differences thus farre open'd I leave it to the courteous and Iudicious Reader.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whereas our Author attributes but a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power unto the care, to beget ſuch hurts, or to make ſtight wounds difficult, or mortall, I thinke hee is in an errour concerning this poynt, the pasſions of the mind ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without any materiall, but I hope he will conclude the ears to be a ſubtill one: ſince it is receiv'd into our veines, and arteries, and according to its impurities and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leaveth there its tincture and condition, theſe peſtiferous ſeaſons are witneſſes, with the allo wance of all grave Writers, beſides many chronick evills, with have beene cured by the onely benefit of the aire: but of this enough.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62419:75"/>longer, when our Author hath cited <hi>Tagaultius,</hi> in eight Cauſes to affirme the uſe of Tents neceſſary, I will briefly examine their necesſity.</p>
                     <p>Firſt when wounds are &amp;c. He cannot thinke that any power in the ſubſtance of a Tent is of a deterging asſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the Cure of wounds, or that in the making it hath any effectuall quality to that worke, what may bee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by its arriving to the bottome is of weake force, to conclude a necesſity, ſince more properly (as it hath beene delivered) that may be effected by fitting Medicines, and the ſering. For the enlarging of wounds, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what he meanes, ſince it hath beene ever allow'd that where wounds for the extraction of any thing infixed in the body are to be enlarged, or for conveyance of any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to performe that duty, it is not ſo convenient to waite the dilation by Tents, ſince in ſuch Caſes there is a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (for the moſt part) execution required, and not delay, (without perill) to be endured; but this by the Knife to be brought to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly in hollow wounds &amp;c. It were a notable piece of folly, to thinke that in the generation of fleſh Tents are requiſite, which in old and unapt conſtitutions, and aged people is to be done, by medicaments that have a power to heale, and thicken the pure portions of bloud ſent to the part afflicted, for ſuch intent, I may well ſay intent, ſince it is natures, for there is an end of all putrefaction, and malignity, there will bee but bad or no generation of fleſh begotten: which good event in the time of growth, and our youth is beſt perfected, more ſlow, after growth of parts, moſt difficult in age.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly in wounds alter'd &amp;c. this hath ſuch dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon what hath beene formerly ſaid, that it need no other diſcourſe to refute it, onely a looking backe to what hath beene already diſputed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly in contuſed wounds &amp;c. I admire Phyſitians of ſuch worth as their labours have regiſtred them to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, ſhould linke objections of one ſort and ſence ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, rather to ſtuffe a Volume and beget number then probability, in contuſed wounds (eſpecially made by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62419:75"/>which are moſt likely to bee with perforation, and thereby to demand the uſe of Tents) what is abſent that hath not beene formerly ſpoken? is there not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ulenes ſince contuſion cannot be diſpatcht without corruption? is there not loſſe of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bſtance, ſince contuſed fleſh which receiveth the aire muſt needs putrify, and bee ſeparated by inciſion, or digeſtion from the ſound portion: and if ſuch loſſe bee, muſt there not bee generation of fleſh, which is ſubſilly and often done inviſibly, as the digeſtive power ſhall rid away the loſt and rotten parts of the contuſion? but I will be briefe.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly in wounds which with phlegmon &amp;c. This is in all moſt unneceſſary: for I would know, if phlegmon or any other Tumour can be ſo healed or removed? may not hard Tents rather cauſe ſuch evills, which being thruſt into the bowells of nature, and ſenſible parts, raiſe up into great paines, &amp;c. I hope our Author will allow ſome other precepts to let the ſury of bad ſymptomes, or he will bee ever attendant with evill ſucceſſe in all his indeavours.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly in thoſe that are made by bytings &amp;c. I muſt ever acknowledge the qualities of ſuch wounds is venemous, which poyſon in them muſt of abſolute necesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be diſcharged, which evacuation muſt rather be done by medicines attractive (then any other kind of remedy) which have a comfortable warmth in them, to alter and digeſt: I cannot be perſwaded that any ſuch power is in Tents, ſimply as they are; theſe ſort of ſolutions rather requiring a liquid body to ſearch and penetrate, then a faſt that ſhall onely hang upon a Tent, and not open it ſelfe to every part of the wound.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, in thoſe that muſt be handled &amp;c. which commonly are by the Diſeaſe open'd when little fleſh is naturally: yet in the fleſhly parts, where the bones are lodged deepe, there is indeed an expedient uſe of Tents, of indifferent length, for in ſuch Fiſtulaes, the Orifice is ſubject to bee drawne together, which out of all doubt muſt bee hindred, for ſuch corruption, or ſuch defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62419:76"/>which have in them a malignity, muſt readily bee emptied, ſince their retaining may cauſe the Vlcer to receive worſe qualities, and degenerate into a more ſordid temper.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, Thoſe that now by oldneſſe &amp;c. the former aſſertion in all points is agreeable to this, and needeth no other reſolve.</p>
                     <p>In the blacke Sea (the <hi>Turkes</hi> being in fight with the Coſſacks of <hi>Ruſſia</hi>) neare the River of <hi>Hoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the deligation, I conclude neceſſary, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the affliction is methodically, either in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Action to hold together, or intentively to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fluxion to the part (by opening a capacity) ſhall inſtruct the Phyſition, in which both of time, and manner, how, and how long to be continu'd, his owne obſervations muſt give him the beſt advice.

For it is to be preſumed, bee it never ſo laudable it would rot, but not in that time: and to ſhift dresſings oftner, it would diſpoſe it to the aire too much, which is moſt hurtfull in wounds, and would hinder a ſecret worke in nature, both incarnative and digeſtive (by a ſuperſtuous moyſture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62419:79"/>hee did in ſport put a knife into his mouth, and it ſinking to the Gullet unawares fell downe and pierced into the Ventricle; deſired that in that miſery I would ſupply him with my advice.</p>
            <p>Hee unbuttoning himſelfe, wee ſaw a place bunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, which after wee very heedfully handled, wee found that the point of the Knife ſomewhat more blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the bottome of the ſto nacke tending to the left ſide, but the haft turned towards the backe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I ſhewed him the greatneſſe of the danger, and that the Knife could not goe backe the ſame way it went in, nor alſo by the inteſtines could posſibly come to bee avoyded; the Patient hereat aſtoniſhed, and conſidering his miſery, earneſtly deſired that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by Section I would free him from inevitable death: But when I ſhewed him too how dangerous it would bee by reaſon of violent Symptomes that might come thereon by ſuch an operation, and adviſed him to commit the matter unto nature, hee did reſt contented with my advice. For I declared unto him that in my time at <hi>Paris,</hi> a Knife likewiſe being ſwallowed downe by a <hi>Iuggler,</hi> the ninth moneth after egreded by the groine. Thus I parted with this wretched man, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly admoniſhing him not to ſtir, nor to ſtuffe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe leaſt the Knife might change its place. And the Surgeon I charged to apply ſuppuratives to the part affected.</p>
            <p>A little while after the Knife endeavoured to come forth, which endeavour the Surgeon furthering with a Magneticall Emplaſter, it did at laſt breake forth. The Knife the Emperiall Majeſty hath commanded to bee laid up amongſt his Iewells, and to teſtifie the Miracle, to bee preſerved.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Matrone, here this yeare one thouſand ſire hundred thirty eight, of the age of fifty yeares was much troubled beneath about the Navill with an Apoſthume, which by reaſon of many cauſes came at laſt to be a Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vlcer, whereunto the humours from all about the body flowed: And ſhe preſently complained of a paine in the left <hi>Hypocondrium,</hi> where alſo a tumor of ſwelling did appeare, which of its owne accord broke and cloſed up againe, a purulent matter by a ſinuous way creeping even to the Orifice of the Fiſtula next the navill, and iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth thereat. By and by after there followed a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter of the meaſe ſhe had eaten: and this was an evident ſigne that the inteſtine there reſident was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For ten daies together of whatſoever ſhe did eate or drinke, two or three houres after there iſſued thereat a kind of Chyle, to the great terrour of the Patient and ſtanders by. The things premiſed that were to be premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I preſcribed her a potion of wound hearbes, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that thrice a day ſhe ſhould take ſomewhat of this Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame. Take of the ſimple Balſame of <hi>Maſticke</hi> ℥. <hi>3.</hi> of the tops of <hi>Hypericon. M. 1.</hi> let them boyle a little and be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>It is wonderfull, after ten dayes paſſed in that Cure, a perfect conſolidation of the internall Vlcer in the inteſtine
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62419:80"/>was obtained, ſo that after that nothing of the chylous matter by the Fiſtulous Vlcer under the navill iſſued forth. Hence we may manifeſtly conclude the unſpeakable power of God and Nature (Gods hand) in the curing of diſeaſes, for which way was it posſible the Chyrurgious hand ſhould arrive at this ſecret vlcer, there to abſterge the matter collected and to cleanſe it? Ho wheit three moneths after the conſolidation made there ariſeth in this wretched body a greater evill; for whereas the Surgeon contrary to the charge of the Phyſitian endeavoured the conſolidation of the ſinuous Vlcer under the navill, behold immediately there is matter collected about the left Hypocondrium, making a new Apoſtume, the opening whereof hee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, and the patient greatly fearing nature does it of her owne accord, and caſteth forth the matter by the gaping lips of the Vlcer. Some few dayes after followeth a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous phlegmaticke matter, ſuch as alwaies lyes upon a mans ſtomacke. To conclude, whatſoever ſhe takes iſſues at the Vlcer.</p>
            <p>All ſignes as well of the matter as of the place affected affeſted that the Apoſtume lurked in the bottome of the Ventricle, and being therewith eaten through and opened, yeelded iſſue for the matter ſwallowed. I could not leave this wretched woman with the <hi>Prognoſticke,</hi> and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all helpe, becauſe as yet ſhe was ſomewhat ſtrong. I preſcribed therefore, that ſhe ſhould uſe with the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſolidating powder of <hi>Bole Maſticke, Lilly Root, Quinteſence</hi> of <hi>Crab's Eyes,</hi> and the like made up together, and that ſhe ſhould uſe this Balſame; of the Balſame of <hi>Maſticke</hi> ℥. <hi>3.</hi> of the Oyle of <hi>Hypericon</hi> well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ℥. <hi>1, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſome three moneths paſt, when the Patient loathed the Medicines preſcribed for her preſervation, and that the Surgeon unadviſedly againe aſſayed the conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fiſtulous Vlcer under the navill (becauſe it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62419:80"/>was the firſt that grew) there in that place next the vlcer was matter collected into an Apoſtume. This a long time after being opened, all that ſhe had taken at the mouth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with had humour iſſued at the gaping. But I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her then that nature could no longer endure any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and curing, becauſe all the Corroboratives and Reſtoratives that were uſed immediatly went forth at the vlcer: and ſhe being ſpoiled of all her ſtrength by the diſeaſe, old age and defraudation of her food, at laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble or feare of death gave up the ghoſt. I could willingly have opened the Corpes, whereby I might have beene an evident eye-witneſſe of the conſtitution of ſo great and hidden a Diſeaſe, but that ſhe deſired not to bee expoſed to view, and put to ſearch out the cauſe of her dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſeaſe, her Kinſ folkes alſo willing to obſerve her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuffered not. But I reſt, for feare I might nauſeate and moleſt your excellence.</p>
